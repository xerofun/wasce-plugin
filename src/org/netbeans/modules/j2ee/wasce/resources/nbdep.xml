    The container-limitation element modifies a plugin to say that not all j2ee deployments are valid.
    For example, a web-only server would include
    <container-limitation> <war-deploy/> </container-limitation>
    to indicate that only war deployments are accepted.
    If a container-limitation element is not present, all j2ee deployments are assumed valid.
    If a container-limitation element is present, then only j2ee deployment types explicitly
    mentioned are allowed.
